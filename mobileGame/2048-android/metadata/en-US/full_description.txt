2048 Puzzle Game

-------------------------------

This is the Android port of the 2048 game made by Gabriele Cirulli https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048
It's just a WebView that loads the locally stored HTML files of the original game.
No ads, and no permissions required. Just open-source. :)

I just wanted to make it instantly playable without internet, and with a quick access icon for my smartphone.
It is a bit slower than native code since everything runs in a WebView.

Long touch for 3+ seconds anywhere on the game if you want to toggle the fullscreen mode.
